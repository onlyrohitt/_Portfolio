How to use this portfolio template
----------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html       -> Main portfolio page (lavender theme, placeholders included)
- projects/        -> Folder for project images (place your screenshots here)
  - project-1.jpg   (placeholder)
  - project-2.jpg
  - project-3.jpg
- images/          -> Folder for profile image
  - profile.jpg    (placeholder)

How to replace images:
1. Open the extracted folder.
2. Replace images/profile.jpg with your profile photo (recommended size: 400x400px).
3. Replace files in projects/ with screenshots for each project (recommended size: 1200x800px or similar).
4. Open index.html in a browser to preview changes.

How to edit links & text:
- Open index.html in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, or even Notepad).
- To change Instagram or LinkedIn URLs, find these lines in the &lt;script&gt; near the bottom:
  const instaUrl = 'https://www.instagram.com/rxhit_stll/?hl=en';
  const liUrl = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-sharma-6256a0220/';
- To update email/phone, search for your email in the file and replace the text.

Deploying:
- You can upload the folder to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (choose the main branch / root) or drag the folder to Netlify for instant hosting.

If you want, I can also:
- Replace placeholders with your actual images from OneDrive (you would need to upload them here), or
- Create a GitHub repo and push the files for you to deploy on GitHub Pages.
